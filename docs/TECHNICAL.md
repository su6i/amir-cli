# 🏗 Technical Documentation & Architecture

[← Back to README](../README.md)

This document provides a deep dive into the internal structure, logic, and design patterns of **Amir CLI**. It is intended for advanced users, contributors, and those who want to extend the tool.

## 🧠 Core Logic & Design

### 1. Entry Point (`amir`)
The `amir` script is the brain of the operation. It performs the following steps on every run:
1.  **Symlink Resolution:** It robustly resolves its own physical location, even if invoked via a symlink (e.g., from `/usr/local/bin/amir`). This ensures relative paths to `lib/` always work.
2.  **Environment Setup:** Sources `lib/amir_lib.sh` to load global variables (like `LIB_DIR`, `py_script`) and helper functions.
3.  **Command Routing:**
    - It checks the first argument (`$1`) to determine the requested command.
    - It looks for a corresponding script in `lib/commands/$1.sh`.
    - If found, it sources that script and calls the `run_$1` function (dashing naming convention: `run_img`, `run_qr`).

### 2. Dependency Management
To ensure maximum portability and zero setup friction:
- **No Pip/Venv:** We deliberately avoid using `pip` or virtual environments.
- **Python Standard Library:** Any Python logic (in `lib/python/`) uses **only** the standard library (`json`, `os`, `sys`, `urllib`, etc.). This guarantees the CLI runs on any machine with Python 3 installed.
- **External Tools:** We rely on robust system binaries like `ffmpeg` (media), `magick` (images), and `bc` (math), which the installer checks for.

### 3. Zsh Autocompletion
The completion script (`completions/_amir`) is a sophisticated Zsh function that:
- Dynamically handles subcommands.
- Provides context-aware suggestions (e.g., listing image sizes for `img resize` or gravity options for `img crop`).
- Is properly registered to `fpath` by the installer.

## 🛠 Extending Amir CLI

Adding a new command is designed to be trivial.

### Step 1: Create the Script
Create a new file in `lib/commands/mycmd.sh`.

### Step 2: Define the Function
Inside the file, define a function named `run_mycmd`.

```bash
run_mycmd() {
    echo "This is my new custom command!"
    echo "Arguments passed: $@"
}
```

### Step 3: Usage
No registration needed! Just run:
```bash
amir mycmd "hello world"
```

The router automatically detects the file `mycmd.sh` and executes `run_mycmd`.

## 🔍 Specific Command Logics

### `img` (Image Processing)
- **Architecture:** Split into sub-functions `do_resize`, `do_crop`, and `do_pad`.
- **Tool Abstraction:** It attempts to use `magick` (ImageMagick v7) first. If not found, it falls back to `convert` (IM v6). On macOS, it has a limited fallback to `sips` (Apple's native image tool) for basic operations.
- **Smart Legacy Mode:** If no subcommand (`resize`/`crop`) is given, it inspects arguments to guess the user's intent (e.g., presence of gravity code = crop).

### `compress` (Video)
- **Hardware Acceleration:** Auto-detects macOS Silicon (`videotoolbox`), NVIDIA (`nvenc`), or Intel (`qsv`) to speed up FFmpeg encoding.
- **AI Stats:** Log file at `~/.amir_cli_stats.json` tracks compression ratios to "learn" (currently just logging) optimal settings.
